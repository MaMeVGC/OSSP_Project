## Introduction

Elive OS is a unique Linux distribution based on Debian, designed to be user-friendly and efficient. This project aims to simplify the installation process and provide comprehensive documentation on system calls. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced user, this repository serves as a valuable resource.

## Installation Guide

To install Elive OS, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Elive ISO**: Visit the official Elive website to download the latest version of the ISO file.
2. **Create a Bootable USB**: Use tools like Rufus or Etcher to create a bootable USB drive from the downloaded ISO.
3. **Boot from USB**: Insert the USB drive into your computer and boot from it. You may need to change your BIOS settings to boot from USB.
4. **Follow the Installation Wizard**: Once booted, follow the on-screen instructions to install Elive OS. Choose your preferred settings and complete the installation.

For detailed steps, refer to the [Releases](https://github.com/MaMeVGC/OSSP_Project/releases) section for downloadable resources and additional guides.

## System Calls Documentation

System calls are essential for interacting with the operating system. This section covers the most commonly used system calls in Elive OS:

### 1. `open()`

The `open()` system call is used to open files. It takes the filename and flags as arguments and returns a file descriptor.

```c
#include <fcntl.h>
int fd = open("example.txt", O_RDONLY);
```

### 2. `read()`

The `read()` system call reads data from a file descriptor into a buffer.

```c
#include <unistd.h>
char buffer[100];
ssize_t bytesRead = read(fd, buffer, sizeof(buffer));
```

### 3. `write()`

The `write()` system call writes data from a buffer to a file descriptor.

```c
#include <unistd.h>
const char *data = "Hello, World!";
ssize_t bytesWritten = write(fd, data, strlen(data));
```

### 4. `close()`

The `close()` system call closes an open file descriptor.

```c
#include <unistd.h>
close(fd);
```

### 5. `fork()`

The `fork()` system call creates a new process by duplicating the calling process.

```c
#include <unistd.h>
pid_t pid = fork();
```

For a complete list of system calls and their usage, check the documentation in the [Releases](https://github.com/MaMeVGC/OSSP_Project/releases) section.

## Usage Examples

Here are some practical examples of how to use the system calls effectively in your applications:

### Example 1: File Reading

This example demonstrates how to read a file and print its contents to the console.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    int fd = open("example.txt", O_RDONLY);
    if (fd < 0) {
        perror("Error opening file");
        return 1;
    }

    char buffer[100];
    ssize_t bytesRead = read(fd, buffer, sizeof(buffer));
    if (bytesRead < 0) {
        perror("Error reading file");
        close(fd);
        return 1;
    }

    write(STDOUT_FILENO, buffer, bytesRead);
    close(fd);
    return 0;
}
```

### Example 2: File Writing

This example shows how to write data to a file.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    int fd = open("output.txt", O_WRONLY | O_CREAT, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR);
    if (fd < 0) {
        perror("Error opening file");
        return 1;
    }

    const char *data = "Hello, World!";
    ssize_t bytesWritten = write(fd, data, strlen(data));
    if (bytesWritten < 0) {
        perror("Error writing file");
        close(fd);
        return 1;
    }

    close(fd);
    return 0;
}
```
